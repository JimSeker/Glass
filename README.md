Google Glass Example code
=====
HelloGlass is a vey very very simple glass app to get started.

GlassInvaders is based on the AndGame in https://github.com/JimSeker/drawing repo.   It has been updated to the screen size,
using glass guesture and a demo of voice (but so slow to use in the game).


These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course. All examples are for google glass and android.
